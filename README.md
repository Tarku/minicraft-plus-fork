## How to build/run in development
Because this project uses a build tool called gradle it is very easy to build or run the project from the source code.

1. Download the source code by clicking the green code button, and download it as a ZIP.
2. Extract the contents of the folder.
3. Open command prompt and enter `cd [folder_location]`, this will open the folder in the command prompt.
4. Type `gradlew run` or `gradlew build` to run or build the program. This might take some time. If on unix, add "./" to the front.
   1. If you built the project, the jar file is found in `build/libs`
   2. If you get an error screaming that you're missing java. You need to [set up](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html) your JAVA_HOME environment variable, or download a JDK if you haven't already.
